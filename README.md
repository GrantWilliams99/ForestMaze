# Overview

This is a simple maze game. The player character is camping out in the woods, but he forgot to bring firewood for his campfire! There are some branches scattered throughout the forest, and he'll need at least four in order to make a decent fire.

Controls:
* W = walk up
* A = walk left
* S = walk down
* D = walk right
* L. Shift = run
* Esc. = quit game

I made this software primarily to become familiar with the Arcade library and its various functions and features and to continue to practice coding with Python. 

Here's a link to a demo of my program: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/-OqaJcqvfoU)

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python (3.9.4) 64-bit
* Git / GitHub
* The Python Arcade Library

# Useful Websites

Here's a list of websites that I found helpful while working on this program:

* [W3Schools - Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
* [Python (3.9.4) Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
* [The Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html)
* [Arcade: A Primer on the Python Game Framework](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)

# Future Work

Here's a list of things that I'd like to add or change in the future:

* Proper screens (Title, Instruction, Game Completion)
* A score-keeping system
* Number of branches collected adds to score
* A timer for two minutes; time remaining is added to score
* Add more sounds (footsteps, trees, campfire, etc.)
* A working flashlight that illuminates the maze
